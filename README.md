## Live Demo
Note: Since the signaling server is hosted on a free plan, the server response time is slow due to which there would be inconsistent behaviors.

## Local Demo
1. First, could you make sure the signaling server is running? To run the signaling server go to [here](https://github.com/surajkarki66/ConnectCam-server)
2. Copy the contents of `.env.sample` into `.env.local`
3. Then run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Happy Coding!!
